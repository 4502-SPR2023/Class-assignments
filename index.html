    <h1>How to make the BEST oatmeal chocolate chip cookies</h1>

    <figure class="gallery-image">
    <h2>Step 1: Get ingredients together</h2>
      <p>These are the best ingredients to make oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. Instead of butter I use butter flavored crisco to make them more fluffy.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Put ingredients in bowl</h2>
      <p>For this step I usually put all ingredients in the bowl besides flour, otmeal, and chocolate chips and then mix. I do not separate my dry from wet ingredients because it will all be mixed together in the end. </p>

    <h2>Step 3: Mix ingredients together</h2>
      <p>After mixing all of the other ingredients, I add my flour, oatmeal, and chocolate chips. Do NOT forget to add the flour because I have made that mistake in the past. Your batter mixture should look like this picture.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Make cookie dough balls</h2>
      <p>Whenever I make this cookie dough recipe, I only make a few cookies at a time. I only want to eat warm cookies fresh out of the oven, so I ball the rest of the dough and put it in the freezer for safe keeping.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Take cookies out of the oven</h2>
      <p>This photo shows what the perfect cookie looks like. They should be golden brown on the outside but gooey in the middle. I always make sure not to overbake my cookies, because who wants a dry cookie?</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Enjoy!</h2>
      <p>This is a photo of my roomate enjoying her first bite of a cookie. She always asks for me to make them for her, so she is super excited I made them for her!</p>
